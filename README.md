# Data Screener
A sample data screening application built using JavaScript's ***Iterator protocol*** and Bootstrap which takes in data and renders it to DOM. In this version the data is constant and hard-coded. However the intention of this application is to act as a template for screening incoming data from any API.

## Features
* Browser side DOM rendering
* Use of Iterator protocol
